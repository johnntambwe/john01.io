         The site gives you the opportunity to find hotels in DR Congo where you can
         make your old dreams come true and dream even bigger.<br>
         <strong>Here is a list of few hotels that we propose:</strong> <br> <br>

          <strong> 1. The Memling Hotel, Kinshasa:</strong> <br>
           Located on the west side of the country, the hotel gives you the opportunity
           to put aside your worries and experience a moment of unparalleled tranquility
           and an excellent place to hold your meetings. <br>

          <strong>2. Hotel Serena, Goma:</strong> <br>
           Bordering Lake Kivu in the north of the country, the 5-star hotel Serana offers you 
           a spectacular view of Lake Kivu with a very qualified staff. 
           The hotel has everything you need to make your dreams come true. <br><br>


          <strong>3. Hotel, Lubumbashi:</strong> <br>
           Located in the mining province of Grand Katanga in southern DRC. 
           The Lubumbashi hotel with international standards gives you the opportunity to be where 
           you need to be and to feel better than at home. <br><br>


          <strong>4. New Palm Beach Hotel, Kisangani:</strong> <br>
           Here we are in the heart of the city of Kisangani in the east of 
           the country where the New Palm Beach hotel runs along the lualaba River. 
           An ideal setting for your meetings, business trips and family vacations. <br><br>

          <strong>5. Pullman Hotel, Kinshasa:</strong>
          If you are ever traveling in the capital of the DRC (Kinshasa), 
          do not hesitate to book a place in this hotel if ever the volume of your wallet allows it.
          Admittedly, the price is a little exorbitant, 
          but the quality of service will always be beyond your expectations. <br><br>

         <strong>6. Hotel Cap Kivu, Kivu:</strong>
         Back in the north of the country, the hotel offers you a spectacular view of Lake Kivu.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        All about who we are, where we came from and where we are going this page is all about it. <br>
        The second page here is the about us page, the purpose is to present you a little bit the historic about <br>
        DyD (dream your dreams) and more detail about the DyD's big project in coming days. <br> <br>      
           <strong>Who we are:</strong>  <br> <br>
	          Actually, we are not “we.”  I’m just a single BYU-IDAHO student learning web fundamental and 
            interesting in  web development career by creating this page which is the first step of making my dream reality. 
            I hope in few days you and I we are going to be “we”, making dreams reality as dream your dreams team member. <br> <br>
          <strong>Where we came from: </strong> <br> <br>
	          We came from a dream, personally I don't really dream since I was a kid (Kidding). That’s just the fancy way of 
            saying all start with a simple desire and an idea of being response to someone else’s quest. 
            I don’t means desire of  creating a search engine like Google and provide answers to any type of answers, 
            I can’t still dream it but the reality is that it has already been invited, so why  should I kill myself creating 
            the wheel again and again? That’s were came the idea of using whatever exist to help people find what the are looking for. 
            Today dream your dreams starts with hotels names and pictures in a specific country but fortunately we can’t stop dreaming even bigger. <br> <br>
          <strong>Where are going:</strong> <br> <br>
