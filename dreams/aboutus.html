            <h3>Where we came from:</h3>
            <p>
                We came from a dream, personally I don't really dream since I was a kid (Kidding). 
                That’s just the fancy way of saying all start with a simple desire and an idea of being response to someone else’s quest. 
                I don’t means desire of creating a search engine like Google and provide answers to any type of answers, 
                I can still dream it but the reality is that it has already been invited, 
                so why should I kill myself creating the wheel again and again? 
                That’s were came the idea of using whatever exist to help people find what the are looking for.
