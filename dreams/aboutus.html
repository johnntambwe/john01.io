                        <p>
                            We came from a dream, personally I don't really dream since I was a kid (Kidding). 
                            That’s just the fancy way of saying all start with a simple desire and an idea of being response to someone else’s quest. 
                            I don’t means desire of creating a search engine like Google and provide answers to any type of answers, 
                            I can still dream it but the reality is that it has already been invited, 
                            so why should I kill myself creating the wheel again and again? 
                            That’s were came the idea of using whatever exist to help people find what the are looking for.
